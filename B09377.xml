            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. I Believe in one God the Father Almighty, Maker of Heaven and Earth, and of all things visible and invisible: And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only begotten Son of God, Begotten of his Father before all Worlds, God of God, Light of Light, very God of very God, Begotten, not made, Being of one substance with the Father by whom all things were made: Who for us men, and for our Salvation, came down from Heaven, And was incarnate by the Holy Ghost of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> And was made man, And was crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate, He suffered and was buried, And the third day he arose again according to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:191906:2"/>the Scriptures, And ascended into Heaven, and sitteth on the right hand of the Father, And he shall come again with glory to judg both the quick and the dead: Whose kingdom shall have no end.</p>
               <p>And I believe in the Holy Ghost, the Lord and giver of Life, Who proceedeth from the Father and the Son, Who with the Father and the Son together is worshipped and glorified, who spake by the Prophets. And I believe one Catholick and Apostolick Church. I acknowledg one Baptism for the remission of sins, And I look for the Resurrection of the dead, and the Life of the world to come. <hi>Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. I own and embrace most firmly the Apostolical and Ecclesiastical Traditions, and all other Observations and Constitutions of the said Church.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Likewise I receive the Holy Scripture according to the sence which the Holy Mother Church hath held, and doth hold, to whom it belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to judg of the true Sence and Interpretation of the sacred Scriptures, and I will never take nor interpret it but according to the unanimous consent of the Fathers.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I profess also that there are truly and properly seven Sacraments of the new Law, Instituted by Jesus Christ our Lord, and necessary to the Salvation of Mankind; althô all of them not to every particular Person, <hi>viz.</hi> Baptism, Confirmation, the Eucharist, Pennance, Extream Unction, Orders and Marriage; and that they do confer Grace, and that Baptism, Confirmation and Orders cannot be repeated without Sacriledg.</p>
               <p n="5">5. I Receive and admit also the Ceremonies received and approved by the Catholick Church, in the solemn Administration of all the above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Sacraments.</p>
               <p n="6">6. I embrace and receive all and every thing that hath been determined and declared concerning Original Sin and Justification in the holy Synod of <hi>Trent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. I likewise profess that in the Mass there is offered to God a true, proper and propitiatory Sacrifice for the Quick and the Dead, and that in the most Holy Sacrament of the Eucharist, there is truly, really and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantially the Body and the Blood, together with the Soul and Divinity of our Lord Jesus Christ, and that there is made a conversion of the whole substance of the Bread into the Body, and of the whole substance of the Wine into the Blood; which conversion the Catholick Church calls Transubstantiation.</p>
               <p n="8">8. I also confess, That under one of the two kinds only, whole Christ Jesus and a true Sacrament is received.</p>
               <p n="9">
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:191906:2"/> 9. I stedfastly hold, That there is a Purgatory, and that the Souls there detained are helped by the Prayers of the Faithful.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Likewise, That the Saints which reign together with Jesus Christ, are to be worshiped and invoked, and that they do offer Prayers to God for us, and that their Relicts are to be honoured.</p>
               <p n="11">11. I affirm most stedfastly, That the Images of Jesus Christ, and of the Mother of God always a Virgin, and also of the other Saints, ought to be had and kept, and that the Honour and Worship due to them is to be give them.</p>
               <p n="12">12. I also certifie, That the Power of Indulgences hath been left in the Church by Jesus Christ, and that the use of them is most healthful to Christian people.</p>
               <p n="13">13. I acknowledge the Holy Catholick, Apostolick and Roman Church the Mother and Mistress of all Churches.</p>
               <p n="14">14. I promise and swear a true Obedience to the Roman Pontiff, Successor of the most blessed <hi>Peter,</hi> Prince of the Apostles, and Vicar of Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p n="15">15. Likewise, I Receive and Profess, without any doubt, all other things left, defined, and declared by the Sacred Cannons and General Councils, and especially by the Holy Synod of <hi>Trent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="16">16. And I likewise condemn, reject, and anathematize all things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; and all the Heresies condemned, rejected, and anathematized by the Church.</p>
